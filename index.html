        Floor: A 10x10 meter plane, rotated to be flat, and colored green.
        Positioned at 0 0 0, the camera (default) will be at 0 1.6 0, looking down at it.

        Surrounding Sphere: A very large sphere (radius 100) centered at 0 0 0,
        colored light blue. This creates an enclosed environment.
        The backfaceCulling="false" is important for spheres that surround the user,
        otherwise, you might see through it from the inside.

      <!--
        Explicit Camera: We define the camera explicitly here so we can attach
        the version text as a child. This ensures the text stays "static"
        relative to the user's view, always appearing at the bottom of their screen.
        'look-controls' allows head tracking, and 'wasd-controls' allows movement.
        Default position for the camera is 0 1.6 0 (average human eye height).

          Version Text: This text entity is a child of the camera, so it moves
          and rotates with the user's view.
          - value: The text content to display.
          - position: Relative to the camera. '0 -0.7 -1.5' places it:
                      - 0 on X: centered horizontally.
                      - -0.7 on Y: 0.7 meters below the camera's center (i.e., at the bottom).
                      - -1.5 on Z: 1.5 meters in front of the camera (readable distance).
          - width: Controls the overall size of the text.
          - align: Centers the text horizontally.
          - color: Sets the text color for visibility.
