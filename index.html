        Floor: A 10x10 meter plane, rotated to be flat, and colored green.
        Positioned at 0 0 0, the camera (default) will be at 0 1.6 0, looking down at it.
      -->

      <!--
        Surrounding Sphere: A very large sphere (radius 100) centered at 0 0 0,
        colored light blue. This creates an enclosed environment.
        The backfaceCulling="false" is important for spheres that surround the user,
        otherwise, you might see through it from the inside.

      <!--
        Camera Rig: It's good practice to wrap the camera and controllers in a
        parent entity (a "rig"). This allows you to move the entire player
        (camera + hands) as a single unit for locomotion.
        'look-controls' allows head tracking, and 'wasd-controls' allows movement
        for desktop testing. Default position for the camera is 0 1.6 0.

            Version Text: This text entity is a child of the camera, so it moves
            and rotates with the user's view, always appearing at the bottom of their screen.
            - value: The text content to display.
            - position: Relative to the camera. '0 -0.7 -1.5' places it:
                        - 0 on X: centered horizontally.
                        - -0.7 on Y: 0.7 meters below the camera's center (i.e., at the bottom).
                        - -1.5 on Z: 1.5 meters in front of the camera (readable distance).
            - width: Controls the overall size of the text.
            - align: Centers the text horizontally.
            - color: Sets the text color for visibility.

          Left Meta Quest 2 Controller:
          The 'meta-touch-controls' component automatically loads the 3D model
          of the controller and handles its position and rotation based on
          the actual physical controller.
          'hand: left' specifies that this entity represents the left controller.

          Right Meta Quest 2 Controller:
